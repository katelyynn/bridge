# bridge, now in vanilla

bridge is a take on the classic bridge duels trope seen throughout minecraft. battle in a 1v1, 2v2, 3v3
along the bridge. the aim is for full customisation and in-built maps. hopefully it gets somewhere
someday, would be cool !!

## integration

this is nowhere NEAR complete or even ready, there's no point downloading it yet.

stay tuned!
